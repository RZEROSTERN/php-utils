Key Generator
=========

If you have worked with SQL Server and MySQL, you'll be noticed that the second one doesn't have a native-like function for uniqueidentifiers. This is a small solution for making similar keys in MySQL with PHP :). You may use it for your commercial or non-commercial developments under CC-BY-SA 4.0 License.
